Problem-solving steps of dynamic programming:

For the dynamic programming problem, there are five steps. After these five steps are clarified!

1. Determine the dp array (dp table) and the meaning of the subscripts
2. Determine the recursive formula
3. How to initialize the dp array
4. Determine the traversal order
5. Derivation of dp array by example
